    <h4>comic actor, film maker, composer </h4>

      <p>
         Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. KBE (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English
         comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a
         worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the film
         industry's most important figures. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in
         the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and
         controversy.
         Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. His father was absent and his
         mother struggled financially - he was sent to a workhouse twice before age nine. When he was
         14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age,
         touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to
         the Fred Karno company, which took him to the United States. He was scouted for the film
         industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp
         persona and attracted a large fan base. He directed his own films and continued to hone his
         craft as he moved to the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was
         one of the world's best-known figures.
